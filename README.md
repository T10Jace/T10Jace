👋 Hello!  Welcome to my profile!


About Me...

  👨‍💻    I am a Computer Science major at the University of Tennessee.
  
  🎓    Expected Graduation date of December 2024.
  
  🧑‍🏭  I am a Technology and Innovation Intern at TVA!

  🌞    In the summer I like to go swimming🏊‍♂️, act like I workout🏋️‍♂️, and occasionally shoot soom hoops⛹️‍♂️!


My Goals...

  🐬    Swim with or touch a dolphin!  (or a penguin, I like penguins too)

  👨‍🎓    Graduate with a B.S in Computer Science.  (At least graduate)

  👨‍🚀    Become an astronaut!  (as soon as I overcome my fear of heights and tight spaces)

  😕    Overcome my fear of heights and tight spaces... and spiders! 

  🧑‍💻  Get a job that I enjoy.  (and pays well... with good benefits)

  👨‍👩‍👦‍👦    Have a family of my own so I can show my kid/s that you never HAVE to actually grow up. (Personality wise, of course)
